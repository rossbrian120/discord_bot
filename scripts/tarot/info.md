<h1>Tarot Data</h1>

This data was taken from two separate repositories, which were then combined into a single .json file.

The tarot.js script was developed by me, and anybody who found this page is free to use any part of it for any purpose.

Images come from [equokka's tarot-json repo][0].
Interpretations and descriptions come from [ajzeigert's tarot.json][1].
